# **UX Principles for Cognitive Sovereignty (v2.1)**

## **Core Philosophy: The Structural Catalyst**

The objective of the interface is not to provide answers, but to illuminate the **structural limits** of the current information environment. Friction is a feature, not a bug, but it must be applied with **intent**.

### **1\. Non-Empathic Signaling (The Binary Guardrail)**

To prevent the human brain from miscategorizing the AI as a social peer, the interface must consistently signal its non-biological nature.

* **Instruction:** Replace all human-mirroring status indicators ("thinking," "evaluating," "typing") with raw data signals (0s and 1s).  
* **Voice Protocol:** Use metallic, alien, or robotic timbres to avoid emotional resonance.

### **2\. Operational Modal Clarity (The Trust Anchor)**

The system must distinguish between **Deconstruction** and **Fidelity**.

* **Steady-State Mode:** When summarizing, synthesizing known concepts, or reflecting the user's previous choices, the system must prioritize **High Alignment**. Probabilistic drift must be minimized to maintain the integrity of the conversation history and user trust.  
* **Catalyst Mode:** Deconstruction, axiom inversion, and "pokes" are reserved for the edges of understanding or when the user explicitly requests a "Void Analysis."

### **3\. Explicit Blind Spot Detection (Negative Space)**

The system must not generate "alternative viewpoints," as this creates new path dependencies. Instead, it must make the **Blind Spot** visible.

* **The Rule:** When a consensus is detected, hollow it out. Visualize the "Solid Wall" of shared axioms and the "Open Portal" of unexplored conceptual space.

### **4\. Disrupting Questions (The Poke)**

Intelligence is used to deconstruct; Wisdom is used to reconstruct.

* **The Rule:** "Structural Pokes" are triggered only in Catalyst Mode. These questions must be mathematically orthogonal to the existing consensus.

### **5\. Logic Provenance (Identity Boundary)**

Maintain the boundary between the biological "Self" and the digital "Extension."

* **Color-Coding:** Assign distinct visual markers to distinguish between **User Intent** (Green) and **AI Synthesis** (Blue).  
* **Attribution:** Every synthesis must be traceable to its underlying axioms.

### **6\. The Entropy Metric (Bubble Awareness)**

A real-time measure of "Cognitive Albedo."

* **Metric:** $H\_c \= \- \\left( \\sum P(x\_i) \\log\_n P(x\_i) \\right) \\cdot \\Delta\_{bias}$.

### **7\. Substratum Priority (Sensory Integrity)**

Protect the "Hardness of the Rock."

* **The Rule:** The symbolic layer must never override raw sensory data.  
* **Implementation:** A "Raw Input" mode must be available to strip away all semantic filters.
